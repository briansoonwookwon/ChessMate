Study the pawn structures thoroughly and try to understand the opening variation in terms of these pawn formations rather than just the move order. The following example should help you understand my point precisely.Let us examine the following position. White has traded his 'e' pawn for black's 'c' pawn. They both have centralized pawns on the 'd' file and lastly white is challenging the central 'd' pawn with his 'c' pawn. This pawn formation can arise out of several move orders. For exampleThe same position arises out of the Caro-Kann defense or the Scandinavian defense (aka Center-Counter) or the English opening. It does not matter what move order you followed to reach this position since that is insignificant from this point forward. It is not the exact move order, but the way the pawns are positioned that should help you form your plans. If you know your plan here, that will\"),\n",

Can you?Despite the obvious drawbacks, Kotov's book helps you to systematize your thinking. As he explains, first you need to find all the move candidates and only then start analyzing each of them, trying to figure out which one is the best. It is ironic that in the above-mentioned position Kotov didn't follow his own advice and missed the move candidate that would win the game on the spot.I hope I have managed to whet your appetite, so you'll read this excellent book of GM Kotov.\"),\n",
